# The Alpine Twist

A classic detectivistic text game, implemented in three different languages, to learn their paradigms in the purest from: Prolog for logical programming, Haskell for functional programming, Smalltalk for objective programming.

## Requirements
- Project should implement an adventure game (also called interactive fiction).
- Topic of the game is unrestricted.
- Game should implement one (or more) of these motives:
    - A closed door, that needs to be open somehow;
    - A hidden item, that needs to be found;
    - An incomplete item, that needs to be completed;
    - Limited resources, like time or money, that are needed to complete a task.
- Game should inform user about available commands.
- Game should have an `inventory` command, that lists all owned items, and its shortcut form, `i`.
- Game should be based around entering commands. For example:
    - `> ask policeman about corpse`

## Deadlines
Prolog: 29/04
Haskell: 20/05
Smalltalk: 10/06
